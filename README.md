    *   **Power Query Editor**: Use Power Query Editor to perform data cleaning.
    *   **Data Type Validation**: Check and transform data types for each column.
    *   **Duplicate Removal**: Remove any duplicate rows.
    *   **Error Handling**: Identify and remove or correct error values.
    *   **Value Replacement**: Replace specific values as needed (e.g., converting "yes" and "no" to binary values).

    *   **Visualisation Selection**: Choose appropriate chart types such as cluster bar charts, area charts, maps, and donut charts to represent the data effectively.
    *   **KPIs**: Design and implement Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to highlight important metrics.
    *   **Interactive Filters**: Incorporate filters (slicers) to allow users to interactively explore the data.
    *   **Formatting**: Customise the appearance of the dashboard, including background images [https://github.com/YaswanthiUnnam/Superstore-PowerBI/blob/cd4c8b156f677874d3303192ae60509e6d4d2147/Images/blue%20bg.jpg], colour schemes, and visual borders.
